## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Each tweak inside the `"tweaks"` array **must be separated by a comma**.
- The `actions` array is optional, but allows for more advanced logic.
- Categories can include:
  - `dll`, `registry`, `config`, `audio`, `misc`...
- Ensure valid JSON format: no trailing commas, correct escaping.
